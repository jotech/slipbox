1. General Description
---

Slipbox is an open source tool for bibliography 
tasks and knowledge organization.

It uses bibtex bibliographic data to collect books,
articles etc. and is primarily concerned to offer
efficient search possibilities, which sufficed 
extensive demands.
In order to provide this functions slipbox turns to
account the 'keyword' entry of bibtex standard and
extended it even to content, like quotes so that it
is possible to establish a quote database, from 
which you can cite a corresponding argument into 
your current text.
Furthermore slipbox broadens the reference service
by bibtex to connect different entries with each other
so that you can get a graph, which shows you your
bibliographic content in a interconnected network.



2. Some more features and more detailed view
---


- Slipbox do not want to replace jabref 
  (http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)
  
  * Additional to jabref it extends search possibilities
    and knowledge representation features.

  * It is not a fork or update of jabref because slipbox
    consists of several small ideas, which should be implemented
    separately first without gui in c++ to keep complexity down.


- Extensive search mask for bibtex entries and indexing
  
  * Keywords listing
  
  * Search bibtex database according specified fields (e. g. author, 
    title ...)

  * By paying attention to keywords and indexing slipbox captures a
    concept by Niklas Luhmann, who explains importance of labeling
    entries with keywords for chance discovery.

        @article{luhmann1993,
        title={{Kommunikation mit Zettelkaesten. Ein Erfahrungsbericht}},
        author={Luhmann, N.},
        journal={Universitaet als Milieu, Haux, Bielefeld},
        pages={53-61},
        year={1993}
        }


- Integration of quotes into bibtex

  * Bibtex entries (articles, books ...) gets extension to represent quotes
    from texts. Each quote receives properties:
    - title
    - description
    - quote text
    - page
    - keywords

  * Each quote belongs to a specific bibtex entry but could be seen as
    additional textual data that is findable and could be cite from 
    external office programs.


- Interconnectedness of data

  * By working with books, articles ... a network between entries arises, 
    when entries and ideas are connected. Each bibtex entry and also each 
    quote should be marked as linked to another.

  * The entry interconnectedness network can be plotted as a graph of nodes
    and edges which represent bibtex entries and their connections.

  * Network output could drawn as an image.


- Expansion of other software (secondary tasks)

  * Latex
    - Cite quotes directly with page number and content

  * jabref 
    - enabling advanced search
    - quoting bibtex support
